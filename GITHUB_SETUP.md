# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

This guide will help you create and populate your GitHub repository for the computational verification code.

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `goldbach-primorials` (or your preferred name)
3. Description: "Computational verification for 'Goldbach's Conjecture for Primorials'"
4. Choose: **Public** (for transparency and reproducibility)
5. ✓ Add README file (we'll replace it)
6. ✓ Add .gitignore: Choose "Python"
7. ✓ Choose license: MIT
8. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Clone and Populate Repository

```bash
# Clone your new repository
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/goldbach-primorials.git
cd goldbach-primorials

# Copy files from this directory
cp /path/to/lpf_symmetry_verification.py .
cp /path/to/README.md .
cp /path/to/requirements.txt .
cp /path/to/LICENSE .

# Create examples directory
mkdir examples
cp /path/to/example_output.txt examples/

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: LPF symmetry verification code"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Repository Structure

Your repository should look like:

```
goldbach-primorials/
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── lpf_symmetry_verification.py
├── examples/
│   └── example_output.txt
├── LICENSE
└── .gitignore (auto-generated by GitHub)
```

## Step 4: Add to Your Paper

In your LaTeX paper, add a footnote in Section 8.1 after Table 1:

```latex
\footnote{Code for computational verification is publicly available at 
\url{https://github.com/[your-username]/goldbach-primorials}}
```

Or in the Acknowledgments section:

```latex
Computational code and data are available at 
\url{https://github.com/[your-username]/goldbach-primorials}.
```

## Step 5: Test the Repository

Ask a colleague (or use a different computer) to:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/goldbach-primorials.git
cd goldbach-primorials

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run verification
python lpf_symmetry_verification.py

# Should see "PERFECT SYMMETRY" for all tested k values
```

## Optional Enhancements

### Add GitHub Topics

On your repository page, click "⚙️ Settings" → "Topics" and add:
- `number-theory`
- `goldbach-conjecture`
- `computational-mathematics`
- `primorial`
- `research`

### Add Repository Description

Edit the "About" section:
- **Description**: "Computational verification of LPF pairing symmetry for primorials"
- **Website**: [Link to arXiv paper when available]
- **Topics**: (as above)

### Create a Release

When ready for submission:

1. Go to "Releases" → "Create a new release"
2. Tag version: `v1.0.0`
3. Release title: "Initial Release - Paper Submission"
4. Description: "Code accompanying paper submission to [Journal Name]"
5. Publish release

This creates a permanent snapshot with a DOI (via Zenodo integration if enabled).

### Add Citation File

Create `CITATION.cff`:

```yaml
cff-version: 1.2.0
message: "If you use this software, please cite the paper."
title: "Goldbach's Conjecture for Primorials - Verification Code"
authors:
  - family-names: "[Your Last Name]"
    given-names: "[Your First Name]"
version: 1.0.0
date-released: 2026-02-07
url: "https://github.com/[your-username]/goldbach-primorials"
```

## Tips for Academic Code Repositories

✓ **Keep it simple** - Focus on reproducibility, not fancy features  
✓ **Document everything** - README should be complete and clear  
✓ **Test before sharing** - Verify code runs on a clean system  
✓ **Use semantic versioning** - v1.0.0 for initial submission  
✓ **Archive permanently** - Use Zenodo for DOI  
✓ **Respond to issues** - Monitor GitHub issues for questions  

## Common Issues

**Issue**: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sympy'"  
**Solution**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Issue**: Code runs very slowly for k=8  
**Solution**: This is expected (4.8M pairs). Takes ~100 seconds on modern hardware.

**Issue**: Different results on different systems  
**Solution**: Should not happen! Report as bug if you see this.

## Integration with arXiv

When submitting to arXiv:

1. Include code link in abstract or introduction
2. Can also upload code as ancillary files:
   - "Ancillary files" → Upload lpf_symmetry_verification.py
   - Label: "Source code for computational verification"

## After Publication

Update repository with:
- Paper citation (DOI, journal reference)
- Direct link to published version
- Any referee-requested modifications
- Extended tests if performed
